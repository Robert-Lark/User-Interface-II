describe the differences in fixed, fluid, adaptive, and responsive layouts:

fixed: These are sites with locked in parameters that do not function correctly 
when the screen size shrinks dramatically - like when viewing on a mobile.
These are the least responsive kind of website.

fluid: Fluid website design removes the hard coded px widths using instead %. These are 
slightly more responsive but still encounter issues when the screen shrinks a great deal.

adaptive: Adaptive designed websites use media breakpoints, these allow for the writing of css 
based on the size of the screen. Contrary to what you might think, adaptive layouts are fixed.
They change depending on the screensize. Different code will run depending on the users device.

responsive: Resposive website design takes every single prior types of layout and combines it 
together. Responsive designs are the standard in todays design space. 

units of measurement

px: - pixel (1px = 1/96th of 1inch) - this unit of measurement is relative to viewing distance for 
low dpi devices 1 pxl is one pixel dot on the display.
em: Relative to the font-size of the parent element (2em means 2 times the size of the parent elements current font)
rem: Relative to font-size of the root element. The root font size defaults to 16 unless changed in the html tag.
%: Relative to the parent element. 
vw: View Width - This unit of measurement is represented as a percentage of the full viewport width. 
10vw Will resolve to 10% of the current viewport width, or 48px on a phone that is 480px wide.
vh: View Height -This unit of measurement is represented as a percentage of the full viewport height. 
10vh will resolve to 10% of the current viewport height.
