describe the differences in fixed, fluid, adaptive, and responsive layouts:

fixed: These are sites with locked in parameters that do not function correctly 
when the screen size shrinks dramatically - like when viewing on a mobile.
These are the least responsive kind of website.

fluid: Fluid website design removes the hard coded px widths using instead %. These are 
slightly more responsive but still encounter issues when the screen shrinks a great deal.

adaptive: Adaptive designed websites use media breakpoints, these allow for the writing of css 
based on the size of the screen. Contrary to what you might think, adaptive layouts are fixed.
They change depending on the screensize. Different code will run depending on the users device.

responsive: Resposive website design takes every single prior types of layout and combines it 
together. Responsive designs are the standard in todays design space.
